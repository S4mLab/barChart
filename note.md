```javascript
const barPadding = 1;

const barRects = binGroups
  .append('rect')
  .attr('x', (data) => xScale(data.x0) + barPadding / 2)
  .attr('y', (data) => yScale(yAccessor(data)));
```

what is d in this case? how I can take a look at it? what is the data type?

the output is an array that contains data objs, but it also contain the x0 and x1 position

array can contain different data type together
